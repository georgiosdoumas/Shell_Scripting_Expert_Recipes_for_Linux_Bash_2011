Page 44 , paragraph "Reading with while" .
The original script presented in the book is (actually in the book it is given as commands typed directly in the shell
but here I present it as a script):
#!/bin/bash
while read ip name alias
do
  if [ ! -z "$name" ]; then
# Use echo -en here to suppress ending the line, aliases may still be added
  echo -en "IP is $ip - its name is $name"
  if [ ! -z “$aliases” ]; then
    echo "Aliases: $aliases"
    else
    # Just echo a blank line
    echo
  fi
fi
done < /etc/hosts
Then an example of output is presented. The /etc/hosts that will produce the given output is not mentioned in the book 
but it should be similar to 
$cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1  localhost spo
#  The  Aliases: following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1  localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0  ip6-localnet
ff00::0  ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1  ip6-allnodes
ff02::2  ip6-allrouters
192.168.1.3  sky
192.168.1.5  plug
192.168.1.10  declan  declan.steve-parker.org
192.168.1.11  atomic
192.168.1.12  jackie
192.168.1.13  goldie smf sgp
192.168.1.227  elvis
192.168.0.210  dgoldie intranet ksgp

Meanwhile the book has all ready mentioned (at the end of page 44) just before the 
while 
do
..... 
done < /etc/hosts 
the following : "Note that it does not deal well with unexpected input, 
such as comment lines (where it says "IP is # - its name is The .."). 
grep -v “^#” | while read 
would be a better method in real life."
But does that is not accurate. The correct is 
#!/bin/bash
grep -v "^#" etc/hosts  | while read ip name alias
do
  if [ ! -z "$name" ]; then
# Use echo -en here to suppress ending the line, aliases may still be added
  echo -en "IP is $ip - its name is $name"
  if [ ! -z “$aliases” ]; then
    echo "Aliases: $aliases"
    else
    # Just echo a blank line
    echo
  fi
fi
done
